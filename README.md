Finished pracitice for parent and child classes.
That was the biggest pain I've even had in student life but hopefully I'll get over it with better understanding through more practicing.

For now I'm downloading project. Hopefully everything's fine here.
Also for Reviewers:
Wish you Happy New year and Merry Christmas. May this year be the worst in your life and next one to be much better with new upgrades in your life.
